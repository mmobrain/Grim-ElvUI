This repository contains the curated ElvUI + Modules collection for **Project Ebonhold** (Ascension 3.3.5a), patched with critical stability fixes.

## Critical Fixes Included

### 1. Minimap Freeze Resolution
**Issue**: `ElvUI_Enhanced` (Minimap Button Grabber) and `MinimapButtonFrame` (MBF) would continuously fight for control over minimap buttons, causing an infinite loop that froze the game client on reload.
**Fix**: `ElvUI_Enhanced` now proactively detects if `MinimapButtonFrame` is loaded during initialization. If detected, the Button Grabber module automatically **disables itself**, yielding full control to MBF. This eliminates the conflict and prevents the freeze.

### 2. SwingBar Recursion Check
**Issue**: `ElvUI_SwingBar` could enter a recursive loop during `PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD` due to unsafe event handling.
**Fix**: Added guards to initialization logic to prevent re-entrant calls.

### 3. Ebonhold Skin Recursion Check
**Issue**: The Ebonhold skin initialization logic contained an unsafe polling loop and lacked recursion guards on the `SetScale` hook. This caused it to fight with other addons attempting to control the frame scale, resulting in an infinite loop freeze.
**Fix**:
- Replaced polling timer with `PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD` event.
- Added recursion guard to `SetScale` hook.
- Implemented "Anti-Fight Logic" to yield execution if conflict is detected.

### 4. Version Check Popup Disabled
**Issue**: ElvUI would display a "ElvUI was updated while the game is still running" popup if the version check logic triggered, even if no update had occurred (common with manual installations).
**Fix**: Disabled the version check logic entirely to prevent false positives and unnecessary popups.

### 5. Shaman Totem Bar Resize Bug
**Issue**: Upon learning a new Totem and unlocking a new slot, the Shaman MultiCastActionBar would break, causing the newly spawned totem icon to stretch to infinite viewport limits.
**Fix**: ElvUI's Shaman action bar code (`AB:CreateTotemBar()`) was injecting style configurations onto natively active totems but completely failed to hook WotLK's `MultiCastActionBar_Update` logic required to process dynamically spawning elements mid-session. Bound `PositionAndSizeBarTotem` to `MultiCastActionBar_Update` forcing the UI to process structural bounds on dynamically incrementing slots.

## Installation
1. Download the latest `zip` from the [Releases](https://github.com/Xurkon/PE-ElvUI/releases) page.
2. Extract the contents to your `WoW\Interface\AddOns` folder.
3. **Important:** Ensure the folder is named `ElvUI`. The folder name **must match** the `.toc` file (which is `ElvUI.toc`) for the game to recognize it. If the extracted folder is named differently (e.g., `ElvUI-master` or `PE-ElvUI`), you **must** rename it to `ElvUI`.
4. **Restart WoW**: You must completely restart the World of Warcraft client for the new addons to load. A simple UI reload (`/reload`) is **not sufficient** for newly installed addons.
